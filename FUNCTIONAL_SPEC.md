### Functional Specification

A functional specification describes how a product will work entirely from the user’s perspective. It doesn’t care how the thing is implemented. It talks about features. It specifies screens, menus, dialogs, and so on.

<strong>A Disclaimer:</strong>

This is a live document. This means at anytime this document may change as  the requirements change. At the time of this writing it is not a complete specification. Graphics and illustrations are meant to show the underlying functionality of the application. The final product may look different based on design changes or user input.
